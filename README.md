# bills_autosort
Short program whose goal is to sort PDF bills based on file creation time.
I am creating this to automate bills sorting from an older software, copy and have them ready to be sent.
This version is Windows only and without GUI.
QT version planned after this prototype is fully functional and safe to use.
